Description: R wrapper function and GMPL mod file used for solving DEA
    problems. One model file contains the linear program necessary to
    evaluate relative efficiency across a set of decision making units(DMU)
    Wrapper reads in GMPL model and data files seperately for ease of use
    and injects key constraints to modify return-to-scale. See documentation
    for more information and examples.
